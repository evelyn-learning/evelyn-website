 * Tutor brain v2 — where the lesson stands, in the terms a partner's portal already reads.

 * v1 reports the current segment, the completed segments and three milestones; the academy shows them as the

 * each of the plan's goals under the same segment ids (plan-map.ts), so the same report is read off that.
